# This repository?

* This repo is one setup to experiment with PiStorm. Largely for my own benefit. Treat anything here as unlikely to work. Use at your own risk.
* It may fry your Pi. It may fry your PiStorm or. It may fry your Amiga. Data (and hair) loss is highly likely. 
* 
* Again. Use at your own risk.
