// Revision History
// v1.0.0 : 2024-01-21 : Added lots of comments to understand what this is all doing. No changes. 
			
/* Basically (as I understand it). This takes 16 data lines and 24 (32) address lines from the 68k and multiplexes them to/from the Pi over 16 GPIO pins.
*  There are 3 output pins from the CPLD to the Pi which communicate IPL, reset status and transmission in progress.
*  There is a Clock pin from the Pi (this is one of the functions of the Pi where you can define a clock) which everything is clocked from.
*  Finally there are 4 control pins from the Pi. One for Read, one for Write and two for what part of the cycle we're in (ie what the 16 pins are currently doing).
*  The four states of the cyle are defined as
* REG_DATA - Read or write data depending on the status of the PI_RD or PI_WR pins
* REG_ADDR_LO - Select the A1-A15 range. Note that A0 is an oddity that doesn't go past the CPLD as it's only used in the 68k to select lower or upper data strobes. As we're faking a 68k though we need it.
* REG_ADDR_HI - Select the A16-A23 (technically A16-A31 but 24-31 don't exist on a 68k!) range.
* REG_STATUS - This is a 16bit "status" register however all it contains is INIT and RESET. It could do much more!
* In addtion the last byte of REG_ADDR_HI is utilised to pass the R/W bit (and in the ST version the FC status).

*  There are four flip-flops (latches) and two buffers (line drivers).
*  The two buffers are there to allow 5V CMOS logic to connect to the 3.6V I/O on the CPLD.
*  The four flip-flops take in data/address on their input and then push it out on the CLK.
*  There are separate flip-flops for Data in (RD) and out (WR) but not for Address. This is because the processor always drives the address. It "activates" a device by selecting the appropriate address and then
*  reading from or writing the appropriate data.

*	The SN74LVC16374 is particularly suitable for implementing buffer registers, I/O ports, bidirectional bus drivers, and working registers.
*	It can be used as two 8-bit flip-flops or one 16-bit flip-flop.  On the positive transition of the clock (CLK) input, the Q outputs of the flip-flop take on the logic levels set up at the data (D) inputs.

*	bus lines significantly. The high-impedance state and the increased drive provide the capability to drive bus lines
*	without need for interface or pullup components.
*	OE does not affect internal operations of the flip-flop. Old data can be retained or new data can be entered while
*	the outputs are in the high-impedance state.
*	To ensure the high-impedance state during power up or power down, OE should be tied to VCC through a pullup
*	resistor; the minimum value of the resistor is determined by the current-sinking capability of the driver.
*	Active bus-hold circuitry is provided to hold unused or floating data inputs at a valid logic level.
